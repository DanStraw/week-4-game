Crystal Colector Game

instructions for the game are on the screen. A random number is given to the user. They must hit any of the 4 crystals, each with a different random value, to add points to their score. They keep clicking the crystals until their score either matches (win) or exceeds (lose) the random number. Win or loss is incremented by 1 appropriately.

Upon win or loss, a button asking to play again will appear. At this time, the crystal buttons are disabled. When player clicks the play again button, crystal buttons are re-enabled and new game starts, with a new random number and new values for the crystals.

This program makes use of jquery to reference classes/ids and for functions
